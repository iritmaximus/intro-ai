# What is AI, really?
Your first exercise will be to take a look into current AI research. Find an AI-related scientific 
article from recent years. Pick one that you can understand, by and large: try to see what the 
problem statement, methodology, and conclusions are, roughly.

Good places to start your search are, e.g., the proceedings of AAAI, IJCAI, and ECAI conferences 
or magazine-style publications that may be somewhat less technical and intended for broader 
audiences, such as AI Magazine. However, please try to avoid articles that are overly polemic and 
superficial -- the idea is to take a look at academic AI, and ignore the BS on my Facebook feed...

Read the article through and answer the following questions:

* What is the research problem?
* Is the topic related to the topics of this course?
* Generally speaking, what impression does the article give about modern AI research? 
  Reflect on the history and philosophy of AI discussed above.
* What studies would be needed to undertand the article in detail?
* Bonus question: Considering the article you chose, how relevant is the ''Terminator'' scenario 
  where AI becomes self-conscious and turns against the humankind?

As my article I chose *Towards Automated RISC-V Microarchitecture Design with Reinforcement Learning*
The research problem was how to optimize microprocessor implementation for RISC-V instruction set
architecture using reinforcement learning (after reading I find out it is not technically AI
but machine learning. Too far in, not changing it. This was still interensting).

The study is clearly related to the topics of this course as it uses AI (machine learning) to 
optimize a selection of parameters that depend on each other. Also after reading the Learning 
objectives for the course there were many familiar theorems and methods that were mentioned in the 
study.

The impression of AI (machine learning) was rather mathematic and "proper". There was no 
overeagerness to utilize it and it did not feel like a magical black box that you put stuff in
and the "better" result comes out. The AI (machine learning) seemed more like a mathematical
equation rather like the magical box. Considering the philosophy of AI I feel like there is not
that much to consider here as the use of AI (ML) was closer to a mathematical equation and
the use case is just to improve efficiency of a microprocessor implementation.

More understanding of AI in general would be needed to understand this study more deeply. Also
deep understanding of the RISC-V ISA (instruction set architecture) and the microarchitecture
is required to understand the problem the study is tackling. No specific study would probably be
needed to understand this well enough if the above-mentioned information is present.

The "Terminator" scenario is not at all relevant as the use of AI is only to optimize a 
microprocessor implementation.
